I interested in using technology to solve real-life problems 

<font size=5>Network Data Camouflage</font>

When I was in high school, I am intersted in Virtual Private Network. The Trojan is particularly popular encryption protocols at that time. I use IaaS to be a site and disguise transmission data as video format. After that, I optimize and customize software client in different platform mostly in linux and its derivative system becasue of inaccurate identification of data diversion. 




<font size=5>Network Performance Optimization</font>
In spare time of college, I was intersted in optimizing LAN performance. At the time when WIFI6 was being commercialized, I searched many technical document related to technical details such as MU-MIMO, OFDMA. The transmission of LAN is limited by the network equipment proformance and non-customization, that's how I got in touch with using sigle-chip machine or PC to be the customized network devices. In customized software-based router, because of mutiple system conflict, schedule and cooperation, I was addicted to it. Moreover, I created a personal video library and file sharing system based on Network Attached Storage to make fun from network.
